### hello world.

In this example we are going to write our `hello-world` program in `deno`, first we create a file called `main.ts` and add the following code in it:

```ts
console.log("Hello World!!");
```

Then navigate to the root folder where your file is located and run the script using the following command:

```shell
deno run main.ts
```

You will get the following output from the console.

> "Hello World!!"
