### packages

In this one we are going to have a look at how we can publish deno modules. We are going to be following [this blog ](https://dev.to/craigmorten/how-to-publish-deno-modules-2cg6) on how to.

Now this is our published package:

1. [crispen-hello](https://github.com/CrispenGari/crispen-hello/)

You can search for it in the [Deno Land](https://deno.land/x/)

Howdy here is my first deno package live online:

```ts
import { add } from "https://deno.land/x/crispenhello@0.1.2/mod.ts";
```
